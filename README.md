## Recipe Book

This application allows you to create and save recipes when you login using google. 

You are able to add and delete ingredients and directions incase you decide you would like to change your recipe a bit.

## Screenshots

For this application I wanted to start simple.

When you first load the app, you will be able to see a list of recipes along with the name of the person who created the recipe.

Scince the user has not logged in yet, they will be unable to see any of the details of the recipes nor create any new recipes.

Once the user logs in with google by clicking on the top right hand corner, they will now be shown the option to see the details of the recipes as well as click to create a new recipe.

When you click on the "ADD RECIPE" button, you will be brought to a page to add the title and style of the recipe you to create.

Once you have made your new recipe page, you can click on the "DETAILS" button to vew the full recipe as well as add and delete ingredients and directions.

## Next Steps

Despite this app having functionality, there can be further improvments:

* Implementing an update function for the user to tweek the directions a little
* Add a delete funciton to the entirety of the recipe
* Make it user friendly for phones or smaller devices
* Make the ingredients into a checklist where you can put a line through the ingredient to show you have gotten it
* Add more css
* Have the user be able to add photos to their recipes
* Create a page that will show the recipes that only the logged in user has made
